# Blue Carbon Literature Database

A search engine for navigating scientific literature on blue carbon. Developed using Whoosh and Flask.

Original project by: [momouan](https://github.com/momouan/nuremberg_trials_search_engine). I have adapted the code to work with a different dataset and added some additional features, such as multicolor highlighting of search terms in the search results and SpanNear queries.

Make sure you install Whoosh and Flask using the following commands:

``` bash
pip install whoosh
pip install flask
```

Open a terminal in the project's root then type:

python main.py

The application will be running on [http://127.0.0.1:5000/](http://127.0.0.1:5000/)

Keywords: Python, Flask, Whoosh, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Jinja2, Search Engine, Information Retrieval, Blue Carbon, Scientific Literature, SpanNear Query, Documents
